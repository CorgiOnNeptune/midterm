# User Stories

- A user story describes how users will interact with your application.
- They have the form: As a **\_\_**, I want to **\_\_**, because **\_\_**.
- eg. As a user, I want to be able to save posts, because I want to review them later.

## User Scenarios

- A user scenario is a syntactic alternative to user stories
- They have the form: Given **\_\_**, when **\_\_**, then **\_\_**.
- eg. Given that I am logged in, when I click favourite on a post, then it is added to my favourites.
